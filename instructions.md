## Instructions:

1. open google chrome and write '__chrome://dino__', this opens dino game.

1. adjust the ranges in your program:-
    1. uncomment the __draw()__ function and comment rest of the functions (because we only need this function now to adjust the range).

    1. enter ranges in __draw()__ blindly but not more than monitor's resolution.

    1. run the program (it will show the screen shot with a  black spot on it according to range you have entered).

    1. perform 2.2 and 2.3 step until you get the black spot on desired pixels (basically black spot should appear just after the dinosour, when the tree or bird hit that spot our dino jumps).~~phew!~~

1. Now enter these ranges in that accquire through __draw()__ function in __dark_obstacle()__ and __white_obstacle()__ function.

1. comment __draw()__ function and uncomment all other function.

1. make sure that __check_background()__ function also has range that must be differ from range acquired (because this will only check the background in game because after some time the background of game dark and obstacles become light)

1. now you can beat your friend's highscore without touching the keyboard.
